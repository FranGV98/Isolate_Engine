## How it works
Camera Control:
- F to focus in a selected gameobject
- ALT + RIGHTCLICK and move to orbit around the selected gameobject
- Press WHEELMOUSEBUTTON to scroll the camera in x and y axis.
- Use the wheel to zoom in or zoom out.
- SHIFT duplicates movement speed

Some tips:
- If you want to select any GameObject from the hierarchy window, in case this GameObject has any children, you have to unfold the parent first and then you can select the object to view its propierties on the inspector.
